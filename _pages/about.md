Hello!

I'm a PhD student at the [Programming Languages, Logic, and Software Security](https://cs.au.dk/research/programming-languages-logic-and-software-security) section of the Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University. I'm supervised by [Amin Timany](https://cs.au.dk/~timany/) and [Lars Birkedal](https://cs.au.dk/~birke/).

My [research](/publications) is about making sure that concurrent programs behave correctly.
For that, I develop formal mathematical tools that allow to prove such programs correct --- and then to check the resulting proofs with a computer.
At the moment, I work on program logics for verifying liveness of blocking and non-blocking concurrency.
Before that, I worked on weak memory models: verifying compilation between them and studying their liveness properties.

[Besides research](/cv), I worked as a software engineer in several (non)commercial projects and TAed a number of computer science classes.

If you're up for a little challenge, here's [the best way](https://www.reddit.com/r/russian/comments/1i08nfn/comment/m6vycn1/) to pronounce my name.
