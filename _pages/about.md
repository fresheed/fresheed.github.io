Hello!

I'm a PhD student at the [Programming Languages, Logic, and Software Security](https://cs.au.dk/research/programming-languages-logic-and-software-security) section of the Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University. I'm supervised by [Amin Timany](https://cs.au.dk/~timany/) and [Lars Birkedal](https://cs.au.dk/~birke/).

My research is about making sure that concurrent programs behave correctly.
For that, I develop formal mathematical tools that allow to prove such programs correct --- and then to check the resulting proofs with a computer.
At the moment, I work on program logics for verifying liveness of blocking and non-blocking concurrency.
Before that, I worked on weak memory models: verifying compilation between them and studying their liveness properties.
