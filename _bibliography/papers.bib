abstract = {Liveness properties, such as termination, of even the simplest shared-memory concurrent programs under sequential consistency typically require some fairness assumptions about the scheduler. Under weak memory models, we observe that the standard notions of thread fairness are insufficient, and an additional fairness property, which we call memory fairness, is needed. In this paper, we propose a uniform definition for memory fairness that can be integrated into any declarative memory model enforcing acyclicity of the union of the program order and the reads-from relation. For the well-known models, SC, x86-TSO, RA, and StrongCOH, that have equivalent operational and declarative presentations, we show that our declarative memory fairness condition is equivalent to an intuitive model-specific operational notion of memory fairness, which requires the memory system to fairly execute its internal propagation steps. Our fairness condition preserves the correctness of local transformations and the compilation scheme from RC11 to x86-TSO, and also enables the first formal proofs of termination of mutual exclusion lock implementations under declarative weak memory models.},
